In this mostly hands-on / interactive lecture, we'll discuss an ecosystem of web technologies and computing platforms relavant to modern neuroscience analysis and data sharing. Where possible we'll use the [neurofinder]() challenge as a practical example. This repo contains links, as well as the intro (an [impress.js]() presentation).
